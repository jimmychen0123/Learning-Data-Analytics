# Learning-Data-Analytics
The practice and project of data analytics made by myself from learning source Lynda.com.
A brief explination of what I do in each file:

01_07_ChartingData: </br>
-Building basic chart visuals by using the report showing what's the most popular videos that employees have access to.</br>
-Alway use copy to protect the original data being manipulate by mistake. </br>
-Chart shows the most watched videos and the top 5% and the bottom 5% of the users for their total count of video access. </br>

Interaction between excel and ppt file:</br>
-Shows the interaction between excel(07_01) and ppt file in different option(Linked, Picture, Embed).</br>

08_01 PivotingData_Start: </br>
-Building two basic types pivots. In tab of Video by Users, it shows the each user who's watched this particular video or each video underneath each users. In tab of Video, it shows the the number of the time for each video that has been watched.</br>
-Modify pivots to make them more readable by showing how many times that video's been watched in percentage of grand total month by month.</br>
-In order to filter the data in pivots, we can insert slice and timeline for the videos.
